Hi, I'm Tim Messer. I'm mostly here to collaborate on a project or two, and to submit my own travel list file updates to the Travel Mapping site (user w9tam).

tamesser/tamesser is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
